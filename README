MySQL UDF Repository
lib_mysqludf_xql

-----------------------

The lib_mysqludf_xql library provides an array of functions, which can be used to create XML output directly from MySQL
using a single SQL query. This prevents having to convert a MySQL result to XML in a PHP script, Ruby script, etc. This
improves performance and simplifies your code.

The library provides the same functionality as SQL/XML, seen in MS SQL server and Oracle. However it uses normal functions.
By using subqueries the same results as SQL/XML can be generated.

lib_mysqludf_xql uses the xmlwriter library of libxml2, which is a superfast non-cached, forward-only generator of XML
data. This library automaticly escapes XML entities and dynamicly allocated memory as the XML content grows. 

For information about using this library, please see API

-----------------------

To build:
 ./configure
 make && make install

To then load the functions:
 mysql -u root -p < installdb.sql

To remove the library from your system:
 mysql -u root -p < uninstalldb.sql
 make uninstall
